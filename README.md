# TTC_Delays_in_2022
A personal data analytics project, heavily utlizing MySQL for data processing, cleaning and exploration

Project objectives:
- Process and clean raw public secondary sourced data effectively, creating and customizing a database fit for project use
- Query data regarding TTC bus, streetcar and subway delays from January 2022 - September 2022
- Investigate patterns, draw insights from data analysis and utlize findings to promote data-driven decisions

The Toronto Transport Commission (TTC) was chosen for this data project, because of a personal interest in Toronto and a desire to deeply undertand its most extensive public transportation system.
As a prospective Torontonian, coming from the UK where public transport is well established and widely available. It was in my best interest to become acquainted with the TTC's biggest downfalls. Being equipped with such knowledge, should hopefully prepare me future-plan my use of the TTC.
